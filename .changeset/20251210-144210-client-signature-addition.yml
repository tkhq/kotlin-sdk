  Added client signature support for OTP authentication support
  - Moved `get_accounts` call from `verifyOtp` to `loginOrSignUpWithOtp`
  - **BREAKING**: `verifyOtp` changed to no longer check for existing sub-orgs, this functionality was moved to `loginOrSignUpWithOtp`
    - `verifyOtp` no longer takes `contact` or `otpType` as params
    - `verifyOtp` no longer returns a `suborganizationId`
